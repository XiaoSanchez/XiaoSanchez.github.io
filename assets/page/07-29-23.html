              BMW Moves Data From The Bars To The Glasses With HUD Smartglasses<br>BMW has introduced a game-changing innovation for motorcycle riders by unveiling its BMW Connected Ride Smartglasses. Developed in collaboration with Israeli tech company EverySight, these smart glasses project essential riding data directly onto the rider's field of view, eliminating the need to divert attention from the road.<br>Connected to the motorcycle's instruments via Bluetooth, the smart glasses display crucial information such as speed, navigation, speed limits, and gear selection on the lens. This advancement aims to enhance safety by allowing riders to maintain focus on the road, contributing to extended periods of vigilant riding.<br>Complementing the launch of the CE02 electric bike/scooter, the BMW Connected Ride Smartglasses can be customized through a dedicated app to adjust the projection location. Once configured, they seamlessly connect with any of BMW's digitally-enabled motorcycles.<br>BMW ensures a reliable power supply, equipping the smart glasses with a lithium-ion battery capable of delivering 10 hours of riding time between charges. The glasses come with a USB cable for convenient recharging.<br>What sets these smart glasses apart is their affordability. Priced at €690, they provide a cost-effective alternative to other options on the market, such as Apple's smart glasses which retail for approximately €4500 in Europe. The BMW Connected glasses are available in both large and medium sizes, and each purchase includes two sets of UVA/UVB certified lenses. One set offers high transparency suitable for helmets with integrated visors, while the other is tinted to combat bright sunlight.<br>Moreover, the BMW Connected Ride Smartglasses are designed to accommodate corrective lenses. Collaborations with optical specialist Shamir Optical Industry have led to the creation of lenses that enhance driver reaction times, alleviate eye fatigue, correct night myopia, and reduce glare.<br>BMW's innovative leap with the Connected Ride Smartglasses marks a significant stride in rider safety and convenience. By harnessing cutting-edge technology, BMW has once again demonstrated its commitment to pushing the boundaries of transportation innovation.
